# Xylophone

## Goal

The goal of this app is to dive into a simple iOS recipe - how to play sound and use an Apple library called AVFoundation. The most important skill of a great programmer is being able to solve your own problems.

## What I will create

I will be making the first musical instrument! Music apps are so popular on the App Store that they even get their own category. So in this module, I am going to make a colourful XyloPhone app. Get it? Ok, the jokes are bad, but remember, I only wrote the good ones... 

## What you will learn

* How to play sound using AVFoundation and AVAudioPlayer.
* Understand Apple documentation
* Functions and methods in Swift. 
* Data types.
* Swift loops.
* Variable scope.
* The ViewController lifecycle.
* Error handling in Swift.
* Code refactoring.
* Basic debugging.
